# Dr\_Quine @ 42
To understand self-replication, one must first understand self replication.

The goal of this project is to build simple self-replicating programs that take
no input and output their own source code (quines).

3 different implementations will be made:
 - C
 - x86 Assembly
 - node.js

## Compiling and running
There is currently no code to compile. Check back soon!
